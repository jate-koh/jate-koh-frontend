### ðŸ“– Description

For my personal usage, of course...

For now, it's really serve no true purpose whatsoever, other than be a place to show others *my noob and non-existent web dev skillz*, and possibly embarass myself at the same time...

### ðŸŽ¯ Target

Even if this website have no purpose now... doesn't mean it have no target or aim...

Here's what I want it to do or showcase, you can say this is **my bucket list** of what to do and what have been done...

- [ ] Showcase information regarding myself (of course, then why have website in the first place?)
- [ ] Provide my contact information (only one I deemed safe enough to show)
- [ ] Can download (essential) file like mods/add-on/textures/etc. that I made for game
...

That's it for now, I may or may not do all of this..., after all this is only where I kept my idea. Thus in the future, either some idea in this list will be rejected and remove, or the list will be longer as new idea is added.
